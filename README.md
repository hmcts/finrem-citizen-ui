# Finrem Citizen UI

## Purpose

This repository contains the HMCTS Financial Remedy Citizen UI.

It provides the citizen-facing web journey for linking and viewing Financial Remedy cases, including:

- sign in via IDAM
- entering a Financial Remedy case number
- entering a case access code
- progressing through citizen case-linking and case access workflows

## Core Citizen Workflow

At a high level, the user flow is:

1. Citizen authenticates via IDAM.
2. Citizen lands on enter case number page.
3. Citizen submits a valid 16-digit Financial Remedy case number.
4. Citizen is routed to enter access code.
5. Citizen submits the access code to link/access the case.
6. Citizen user flows follow. 

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.22.0`
- Yarn `4.x`
- Docker (optional, for containerized local runs)
- Playwright browser dependencies (installed automatically by `yarn test:functional`)

## Run the App Locally

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22.22.0 or later (Updated for Node 22 migration)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v4.x
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Build assets:

```bash
yarn build
```

Start app:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

Default local URL:

- `http://localhost:3100`

### Session Store for Local Development

By default, production-style config uses Redis-backed sessions.  
For local development you can simplify setup by using:

- `SESSION_STORE=memory` for in-process session storage (default in `dev`/`test` config)
- `SESSION_STORE=file` for file-backed sessions

Optional file mode path override:

- `SESSION_FILE_STORE_PATH=./.sessions/local-sessions.json`

## Run with Docker

Build image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the frontend container exposing the application's port
(set to `3100` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can visit https://localhost:3100 in your browser.
You should get a very basic home page (no styles, etc.).

## Test Commands

### Unit and Route Tests (Jest)

Run default local test command:

```bash
yarn test
```

Run all unit tests:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

Run route-specific tests:

```bash
yarn test:routes
```

Run with coverage:

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

### Smoke Tests

Smoke tests verify key route availability and basic service readiness:

```bash
yarn test:smoke
```

### Functional Tests (Playwright)

Run PR-tagged functional suite (`@PR`, Chromium):

```bash
yarn test:functional
```

Run broader functional suite with configured retries:

```bash
yarn test:full-functional
```

### Accessibility Tests (Playwright + axe)

Run accessibility-tagged tests (`@a11y`, Chromium):

```bash
yarn test:playwright:a11y
```

Run and open the generated a11y report in one command:

```bash
yarn test:playwright:a11y:report
```

Open the latest a11y report manually:

```bash
yarn playwright show-report a11y-output/axe-report
```

Note:

- The accessibility HTML report path is `a11y-output/axe-report`.
- Running `yarn playwright show-report` without a path looks for the default `playwright-report` folder.

## Where Test Artifacts Go

- Functional report artifacts: `functional-output/`
- Smoke report artifacts: `smoke-output/`
- Accessibility report artifacts: `a11y-output/`
- Allure Playwright results (when enabled in reporter config): `allure-results/`

## Test Structure

- Functional specs: `src/test/functional/specFiles/`
- Page objects: `src/test/functional/pom/`
- Shared Playwright fixtures: `src/test/fixtures/fixtures.ts`

## Linting

Code style and quality are enforced with:

- ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript
- Prettier for formatting
- Stylelint for stylesheets

Run lint:

```bash
yarn lint
```

Run lint with auto-fix:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

Run staged-file checks (used by git hooks):

```bash
yarn lint-staged
```
